## HTML

## Questions and answer

### What is Emmet?

-Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. The project was started by Vadim Makeev in 2008 and continues to be actively developed by Sergey Chikuyonok and Emmet users.
And Emmet does fulfill what they promise, you can use short expressions to generate HTML markup, CSS.

- Series of expression:-
  1. Generating HTML Skeleton
  2. Elements with text content inside them div{This is a div}
  3. Nested elements ul>li\*3>a
  4. What about classes and Id:-div#main.container.responsive
  5. Custom attributes div[data-name=logo]
  6. Generating Siblings. (header+div+footer)
  - Let‚Äôs say you want to have a header tag, div tag, footer tag. What would you do?
  7. Grouping- div>(a>p>span+span)\*3
  8. Lorem Ipsum- lorem lorem\*5

## CSS

- Margin of 10 on all sides

  - margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
- padding : padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;

## Difference between a Library and Framework?

## Library vs Framework

| Aspect                | Library                                               | Framework                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | Collection of functions or classes for specific tasks | Comprehensive set of tools and guidelines for application development |
| **Focus**             | Provides specific functionalities or operations       | Defines architecture and imposes structure                            |
| **Control Flow**      | You control the flow of your application              | Framework dictates the flow and calls your code                       |
| **Flexibility**       | More flexible, integrates with existing code          | More opinionated, follows specific conventions                        |
| **Extent of Code**    | Provides specific functionalities or tools            | Includes libraries and defines application structure                  |
| **Examples**          | `requests` for HTTP requests in Python                | Django for web development in Python                                  |
| **Usage**             | Use where specific functionalities are needed         | Use for structured application development                            |
| **Decision Criteria** | Flexibility, targeted functionalities                 | Structured development, enforce conventions                           |

### Summary

- **Libraries** are focused on providing specific functionalities and tools, offering flexibility and integration with existing code.
- **Frameworks** encompass a broader set of tools and guidelines, providing a structured approach with predefined conventions and architecture.

## ‚óè What is CDN? Why do we use it?

- A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
- They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its deliver
- What is the need for CDN?
  - CDNs balance the load of network traffic, ensuring no one server gets overwhelmed. In the event that a single server stops working, a CDN can initiate a "failover" process that allows a backup server to take over.

## Why is React known as React?

- React is aptly named because: It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

## What is crossorigin in script tag?

- üîªCrossorigin attribute is used when a script on one domain is trying to fetch or interact with resources from another domain. üîªHere we're are fetching CDN links of React. üîª

## What is diference between React and ReactDOM?

- React provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment.

## ‚óè What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

- In production mode, compression and minification of Javascript and other resources happens to reduce size of the code which is not the case when it comes to development mode. Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode.

## What is async and defer?

- async and defer both load JavaScript asynchronously without render blocking, but async executes as soon as possible and in no particular order while defer runs in sequence toward the end of the loading process, just before the DOMContentLoaded event.

## What is `NPM`?

- it is a package manager who manages for other packages but it does not have any abbriviations. it manages for javascript libary and framework which run on the node packages.

## - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

- Parel/Webpack is a bundler for react applications which is taken care all everything about the development. it makes minification, https, hot reloading, dev build, file watching algorithm , image optimizations, image optimization,compress the file , consistent hashing, code spliting, diffrential building ,diagonistic , error handling, tree sparking to remove unused code, diffrential dev and production builds.

## What is `.parcel-cache`?

- it stores the informations about the projects when parcel builds it . so that it rebuilds , does not have re-parse and re-analyize from scratch . it is a key reson , why parcel can be so fast in development.

## What is `npx` ?
 - What is NPX? NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.

## What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
 - A dependency is a library that a project needs to function effectively. DevDependencies are the packages a developer needs during development.
- The 'npm install' command should add all the dependencies and devDependencies automatically during installation. If you need to add specific devDependencies to your project, you can use this command- 'npm install --save-dev'.

##  What is Tree Shaking?
 - Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.

- It relies on the import and export statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.

- In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers (e.g., webpack or Rollup) to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

## What is Hot Module Replacement?
 - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways: Retain application state which is lost during a full reload. Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.

## List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words?
 - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) parcel keeps track of file changes via file watcher algorithm and renders the changes in the files
 - File watcher algorithm - made with C++ Minification
 - Cleaning our code

## What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
 - A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected. 
## - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
  ### The Role of package.json:
   1. Project Configuration
   2. Dependency Management
   3. Version Management

  ### The Role of package-lock.json
   1. Dependency Locking
   2. Version Consistency
   3. Improved Installation Speed

   ## difference between role of package.json and package-lock.json 

| **Aspect** | **package.json** | **package-lock.json** |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Contains basic information about the project. | Describes the exact tree that was generated to allow subsequent installs to have the identical tree. |
| **Necessity** | Mandatory for every project. | Automatically generated for operations where npm modifies either node_modules tree or package.json. |
| **Metadata** | Records important metadata about the project. | Allows future developers to install the same dependencies in the project. |
| **Contents** | Contains information such as name, description, author, script, and dependencies. | Contains the name, dependencies, and locked versions of the project. |  
## dependencies

there are two type of dependency
1.dev dependency
2.normal dependency

parcel:-Parcel is a zero configuration build tool for the web. It combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to massive production application.

## Laying the foundation 
  // this is not html in javascript 
  - const jsxsyntex =`<h1 className="" >this looks like html/xml</h1>`
  -this is converted or transpile or compile by babel into react element 
  - if you give attribute in inside the jsx then it should be in camel case like =tabIndex
